# VaporStation
A toy playstation emulator written in rust. Better than my nes emulator, but still not anywhere near idiomatic rust.

# Why VaporStation?
![Vaporwave test rom](https://i.imgur.com/xs7LBiG.png)
The name VaporStation is in reference to the internet aesthetic known as vaporwave. The picture above was the output of a broken test, and in my opinion is a bit vaporwaveish. People in the EmuDev discord agreed, and suggested the name VaporStation.
